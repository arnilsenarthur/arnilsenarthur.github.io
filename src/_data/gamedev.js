  bio: [
    "I'm a passionate <b>game developer</b> and <b>technical artist</b> with over 10 years of experience, starting my journey at age 13 through Minecraft modding and evolving into a specialist in multiplayer game development and network architecture. My path has taken me from self-taught Java programming to working at leading game studios, continuously pushing the boundaries of interactive entertainment.",
    "Currently working as a <b>Tech Artist & Software Engineer</b> at <b>Triplo Studios</b>, I previously worked on multiplayer game development at <b>Fried Chicken Labs</b> (Snackclub ecosystem) using Photon's Quantum Engine. During this time, I developed expertise in high-performance networking and contributed to games serving thousands of concurrent players.",
    "I've created <b>NetBuff</b>, a custom high-performance networking library for Unity that reduced network latency by 40% and simplified multiplayer implementation for commercial games. My portfolio showcases diverse projects including award-winning cooperative games like <b>Solis</b> (Best Game Design winner), competitive multiplayer shooters, and innovative technical achievements like a 3D chess engine with full Stockfish AI integration.",
    "I excel in <b>Unity 3D</b>, <b>C#</b>, <b>multiplayer networking</b>, and <b>performance optimization</b>, with extensive experience in <b>LWJGL graphics programming</b>, <b>Java modding</b>, and <b>cross-platform development</b>.
